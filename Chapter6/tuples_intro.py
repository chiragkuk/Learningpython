# # tuple data structure

# # tuple can store any data type @
# # most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update
# # data inside tuple a
example = ('one', 'two', 'three')
# # no append , no insert , no pop , no remove
#tuples are faster
# methods- length,count,index,slicing

print (example[:2])
